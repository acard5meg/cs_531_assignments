Questions to professor
1. B/C we have to enter database name can we remove the user input to 
    get the filename?
2. Can we assume the SQL table is setup the same way as the text file with no additional cols
    column 1: IPv4
    column 2: alias
3. For add_address, do we still get user input therefore don't need to account SQL?
4. Are we always saving back into the same SQL table so we don't need to get user input about table?
5. Do we need to delete the table then recreate it
- Instances where entries in table at initialization are invalid
- If we simply write back then we'd duplicate


Read in IPv4 address/alias from file. 
Bad number -> Good
bad alias -> Good
duplicate number -> Good
duplicate alias -> Good
empty file -> Good
invalid filename -> Good

Make sure you use nodes in different locations of the list including front, rear, somewhere in middle

Do everything on an empty list

For 1)
Valid IPv4 and valid alias
valid alias: a
valid alias: abcdefghij

Invalid first -1 -> Good
Invalid second 256 -> Good
invalid third 10003 -> Good
invalid fourth: 1234 -> Good
invalid alias: empty -> Good
invalid alias: abcdefghijk -> Good

repeat ipv4 not alias -> Good, always check display list
not ipv4 repeat alias -> Good, always check display list
not ipv4 repeat diffcase alias -> Good

For 2)
Alias in list -> Good
Alias not in list -> Good

For 3)
Alias in list, update properly, redisplay list -> Good
diff case alias in list, update properly, redisplay list -> Good
Alias not in list -> Good
alias in list, address is duplicate -> Good
alias in list, address is invalid -> Good, could test all 4 components

For 4)
Proper alias, confirm deletion (first, rear, middle) -> Good
proper alias, deny deletion -> Good
proper alias, incorrect input -> Good
delete from empty list -> Good

For 5)
Empty list -> Good
List with x nodes -> Good
List with x+1 nodes -> Good

For 6)
Separate values with " " and . -> Good
Value out of range (Re-prompt) -> Good
Location doesn't exist (Error message) -> Good
Good value -> Good

For 7)
Do it -> Good
Try to overwrite a file -> Good

For 8)
Good

All empty list 2-6 good
